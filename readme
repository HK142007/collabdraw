INSTALLATION:
______________
1. Install nodejs
2. Install mongodb
3. "npm install socket.io"
4. "npm install mongodb"
5. Install ffmpeg to enable conversion to video feature
6. "npm install canvas" to enable conversion to video feature
    This might require installation of various dev libraries including jpeg, png and gif libraries, cairo, and the standard build tools (gcc). The libraries that are missing will be shown in error messages while trying to install this.
    
    
RUNNING:
-----------
1. Run the mongodb database using "mongod"
2. Run the nodejs server using "node server.js"
    Where server.js is in the root directory of the project
3. Put the entire project in the htdocs/public_html folder of any server that can serve php (apache, nginx, etc.)
4. Replace "http://128.83.74.33:4001" in both index3.php and js/Canvas.js to the IP and port of the server running nodejs.
    (index3.php contains the UI rewritten in Sencha Touch. index.php contains the older UI that uses jQuery. The nodejs server address needs to be replaced in this too if you intend to use it.)
5. Open "http://apache-server-address:port/canvas-draw-dev/index3.php" in Safari on iPad or Safari on Mac OS X / Windows. (This is the site that uses the Sencha touch UI. Open index.php to see the older UI that doesn't work as well, but has all the features)
